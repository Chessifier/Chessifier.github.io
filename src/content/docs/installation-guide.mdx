### Error message

If you encounter the following error message:

* Chessifier.app is corrupted and cannot be opened.
* Apple could not verify “Chessifier” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

### Cause of error

Since the application needs an official signature to avoid the pop-up "app is damaged" prompt after installation, but the official signature fee is expensive ($99 per year), which is unaffordable for open source projects. Therefore, it is necessary to manually bypass the signature to use Chessifier normally.

### Solution

1. On your Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Privacy & Security  in the sidebar. (You may need to scroll down.)

2. Go to Security, then click Open.

3. Click Open Anyway.

    This button is available for about an hour after you try to open the app.

4. Enter your login password, then click OK.
